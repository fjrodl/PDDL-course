# PDDL-course


## Exercises Block PDDL

### Exercise 1

Classic example of a robot navigating between rooms.

The student needs to play between the cost of navigation in order to understand the effects on planner solutions.


### Exercise 2

Example extracted from IPC competition. It is possible to see the robot behavior in different contexts. The examples present approaches associated to a possible rover. 

Goal: to test all planners

### Exercise 3

Example of a PDDL domain and problem for a robot gripper for assembling blocks. 

Goal: to observe the sussan anomaly. 

Tools: popf vs vhpop


### Exercise 4: Complexity

Example of a PDDL domain and problem for a specific field, cybersecurty. Extracted from IPC 2012.

Goal: to observe the complexity associate to some specific domains.
